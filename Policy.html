    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Glossary GPT is a custom AI assistant that reads and updates a bilingual glossary stored at
      <code>Glossario.csv</code> in the GitHub repository <code>Cristale92/Glossary-API</code>.</p>

    <h3>What data we process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>User prompts and instructions provided to the GPT inside OpenAI’s interface.</li>
      <li>Repository details necessary to operate (owner/repo, file path <code>Glossario.csv</code>, branch <code>main</code>).</li>
      <li>File contents of <code>Glossario.csv</code> to read and commit updates.</li>
      <li>Commit metadata (commit message, file SHA, timestamps) when changes are made.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Authentication & tokens</h3>
    <p>Access to GitHub is performed using a Personal Access Token (PAT) that you configure within OpenAI Actions.
       The token is transmitted by OpenAI to GitHub for the API calls and is not collected by us outside of OpenAI’s platform.
       You may revoke it anytime in your GitHub settings.</p>

    <h3>How we use data</h3>
    <p>Data is used solely to maintain your glossary (read, add, update, delete entries) as requested by you.
       We do not sell your data. Data is shared only with GitHub via its REST API in order to read/write the file.</p>

    <h3>Data retention</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No separate database is maintained by us; your glossary persists in your GitHub repository and commit history.</li>
      <li>Conversation data may be retained by OpenAI per their policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Your choices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Revoke or rotate your GitHub PAT at any time.</li>
      <li>Edit or delete the glossary file in your repository.</li>
      <li>Delete commits or the repository according to GitHub’s features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third parties</h3>
    <p>This GPT interacts with GitHub’s REST API. Please review GitHub’s own privacy practices.</p>

    <h3>Children’s data</h3>
    <p>This service is not intended for children under the age required by local law. We do not knowingly collect such data.</p>

    <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date above.</p>
